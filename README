A browser plugin for google chrome that can be activated in specific pages to enable hand gesture interaction in web pages. Requirements: A webcam A javascript-enabled browser A hand (Even a pentium can run this!) What's the need?: Providing a cheap and easy alternative to expensive gadgets like Kinect for Human-Computer Interaction For lazy geeks like us What can we do with this? Easily extend navigation to many websites like - Youtube, Facebook, Gmail, Google Maps, 8tracks, RSS feeds, Presentations and many more Usage can be extended to easy navigation of Smart TV's. (Navigation web pages with a remote can be a real pain) How does it work? We use an image processing javascript library (https://github.com/tjerkw/js-cam-motion) to track preset motion gestures using a webcam. We then trigger browser events using DOM elements and Google chrome API Future improvement Multi-hand gestures for a wider range of applications
